# RoadSignRecognition-NeuralNetworks

This repository is related to Computer Vision course purposes at ECE, DUTH.

In this project, I worked on designing my own neural network from scratch and utilizing the pretrained ResNet50 network for automatic recognition of road sign images. The process involved extensive experimentation to optimize the architecture, which included data collection, initial architecture design, performance-driven modifications, loss function selection, parameter tuning for data augmentation, and systematic training and validation.
